# GoDash - simple dashboard

The purpose in building this is solely for listing down any tools or related links needed for development. 
It could include Monitoring Tools, Documentations Links, etc. 
With this, we can just visit one central dashboard, to link us everywhere.

I usually utilise this to list down my monitoring tools in every environment, and my documentation page.

Hopefully this could help anyone who has the same intention as me. :)
